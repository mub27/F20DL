Lab work for data mining and machine learning

Initially the dataset the group used was top 2000 universities but after pre processing and data cleaning the values was cut down to only around 160 instances as it had a lot of missing values

We then decided to use a different dataset that tracks the performance of students from 2 Portuguese schools.

This dataset was better as it had no missing values and is fairly large with many attributes
